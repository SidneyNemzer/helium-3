## Overview

Up to four players can participate in a match. Each player takes turns moving up to two of their five X-TRACT robots. Players can set up moves before their turn. The winner is the player who has mined the most Helium 3 at the end of the game, and still has at least one X-TRACT robot alive.

4. Shield
5. Mine
6. Move
