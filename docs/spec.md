## Matches

Four players compete in a ten minute battle. The battle takes place on the moon in a 20x20 grid. Players take turns moving two of their five robots to mine Helium 3 or attack other robots. The winner is the player with the most money and at least one X-TRACT robot at the end of the game.

$40,000 of Helium 3 is randomly distributed over the moon's surface before the game starts. Helium 3 tends to concentrate in clumps.


## X-TRACT Robots

Each player starts with five X-TRACT robots.  Players may move up to two robots on their turn.

Robots start in the "inactive" state, in which they are immune to damage. After a robot performs any action, it enters the "active" state, and can be destroyed. This keeps inactive robots safe until they are in play. When a robot is destroyed, 50% of the Helium 3 that the robot mined is dropped onto the surface, with most of it settling on the robots current square and some in neighboring cells.

An X-TRACT robot can preform one of the following actions per turn:

| Action       | Move Range | Notes |
|--------------|------------|-------|
| Arm Missile  | 2          | Any other action disarms the missile. |
| Arm Laser    | 2          | Any other action disarms the laser. |
| Fire Missile | 0          | Range of missile: 6. Destroys robots that are directly hit. |
| Fire Laser   | 0          | Destroys all robots in a line. Fires on a 45 degree angle. |
| Kamikaze     | 0          | Destroys self and robots in neighboring squares. |
| Shield       | 5          | See [Shield](#shield). |
| Mine         | 4          | See [Mining](#mining). |
| Move         | 6          | |

"Move" obviously allows X-TRACT robots to move around the map. Some other actions allow the robots to move, but not as far as a dedicated move.


### Mining

X-TRACT robots can mine Helium 3 from the moon's surface. Mining a square removes up to $500 of Helium 3 from the square under the robot and $250 of Helium 3 from each neighboring square.


### Shield

Players can only see shields on their own robots.

Robots with an active shield are immune to all damage, but taking any damage or performing any action disarms the shield. Hitting a shielded robot with a laser stops the laser.

Shields can also be used to deflect lasers; when shielding a robot, the player can optionally choose a direction to deflect lasers. Any lasers hitting the shield deflect in the chosen direction. Just like firing a laser, deflection happens at 45 degree angles (including back at the source of the laser). A laser can be deflected by multiple robots.
