## Mining Robots

Each player starts with five mining robots. Robots start in the "inactive" state, which makes them immune to damage. Players may move up to two robots on their turn.

### Actions

Robots start in the "inactive" state. After an action has been performed, they enter the "active" state, which allows them to be destroyed.
