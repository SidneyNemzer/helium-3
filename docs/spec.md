## Overview

Up to four players can participate in a match. Each player takes turns moving up to two of their five bots. Players can set up moves before their turn. The winner is the player who has mined the most Helium 3 at the end of the game.

## Mining Robots

Each player starts with five mining robots. Robots start in the "inactive" state, which makes them immune to damage. Players may move up to two robots on their turn.

### Actions

Robots start in the "inactive" state. After an action has been performed, they enter the "active" state, which allows them to be destroyed.

A few basic actions can be performed at any time. Some actions are contextual.
